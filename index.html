        <h1>My story,</h1>  
        <h2>So far...</h2>
            <p>My name is Bradley Norman and I am a public relations student enrolled at the University of Florida. My interests include art, both fine and street, fashion, film and the entertainment industry as a whole, politics, and journalistic and fiction writing.</p>
            
<p>I hope to one day work as a public relations practitioner within the corporate sector. Despite my desire to pursue a career in the field of public relations, I truly enjoy writing. It is something I could easily see myself doing in the future or on the side for a monthly fashion, political or travel publication.</p>
        
         <!--I don't really like the style of a footer navigation and I think it's kind of unnecessary but I wasn't sure whether or not footer navigations were a requirement. Being that this is my personal website, I feel like I should be allowed to decide whether or not to include one. I hope you understand and if you believe it should be a requirement, please let me know and I will gladly add one.-->
