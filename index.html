        <h1>My story,</h1>  
        <h2>So far...</h2>
            <p>My name is Bradley Norman and I am a public relations student enrolled at the University of Florida. My interests include art, both fine and street, fashion, film and the entertainment industry as a whole, politics, and journalistic and fiction writing.</p>
 
            <p>My time at the University of Florida has helped polish and refine my skills. My education has provided me with strong communication skills, both oral and written, as well as motivational and organizational prowess. My ability to multi-task and my strong time-management skills grew throughout my college experience, in which I juggled as many as seven classes at any given time.</p>
            
            <p>I hope to one day work as a public relations practitioner within the corporate sector. Along with my personal interests in event management and planning, public relations and social media, I boast an acute attention to detail and an upbeat, pro-active attitude. Despite my desire to pursue a career in the field of public relations, I truly enjoy writing. It is something I could easily see myself doing in the future or on the side for a monthly fashion, political or travel publication.</p>
        
         <!--I don't really like the style of a footer navigation and I think it's kind of unnecessary. Being that this is my personal website, I feel like I should be allowed to decide whether or not to include one. I hope you understand and if you believe it should be a requirement, please let me know and I will gladly add one.-->
