            <p>My name is Bradley Norman and I am 20-year-old public relations junior enrolled at the University of Florida.</p>

            <p>My time at the University of Florida has helped polish and refine my skills. My education has provided me with strong communication skills, both oral and written, as well as motivational and organizational prowess. My ability to multi-task and my strong time-management skills grew throughout my college experience, in which I juggled as many as seven classes at any given time.</p>

            <p>This refinement of skills and my chaotic schedules helped me realize just how much I truly enjoy being busy and working. I love to immerse myself in difficult tasks because, while I know they will be very hard and time consuming, I know I will take something greater away once I’ve completed what I said out to do. This website, for instance, was one case in which I dove right in head first and I’m so happy I did.</p>

            <p>Through the University of Florida and the College of Journalism and Communications, my love for journalistic writing has flourished. What started off as a task, an assignment that I had to complete to move on to courses more focused on my major, blossomed into a passion. I never thought I’d find myself actively seeking out stories and pitching them to my editor, who has inspired me so much as a person, or taking 12-hour writing assignments. The feeling, the rush, I get from seeing my pieces run in the local paper is so fulfilling, I crave it. You can view a collection of my published works on my portfolio page.</p>

            <p>My interests include fashion, film, music and politics. When I first decided on public relations as a major, as a life, as a future, I was certain I’d spend my life after college as a fashion publicist. However, opportunities for greater advancement have presented themselves and I’m taking them by the reins and riding them for as long as I can.</p> 
                
            <p>Who knows where I’ll be 2, 5, or 10 years from now, as long as I’m doing what I love, I know I’ll be happy.</p>
