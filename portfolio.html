            <a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/campus/article_71fa36f8-a03e-11e3-bc32-001a4bcf887a.html">Indoor tanning linked to higher cancer rates than smoking</a>
            <p>A story regarding a study published by JAMA Dermatology stating that the number of skin cancer cases due to indoor tanning is higher than the number of lung cancer cases due to smoking. This was the first ever story I pitched to my editor for publication. What influence me to pitch this story was the fact that it was just hard news, I pitched this story right before Spring Break in an effort to raise awareness about the dangers of indoor tanning.</p>
            <br><a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_d2e27adc-8a3d-11e3-8567-001a4bcf887a.html">Fitness hunks to be auctioned off</a>
        <p>A Gainesville gym was hosting a "man pageant" and auction in order to raise money for their charitable mission of constructing strength and flexibility fitness parks in town. I truly enjoyed writing this story as it was light-hearted and a bit silly.</p>
            <br><a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_e713e21c-8c99-11e3-82ac-0019bb2963f4.html">Westside Samaritans women’s clinic opening Gainesville location</a>
        <p>A local clinic aimed at providing services to uninsured patients, patients with incomes at a certain federal poverty level or patients that qualify under state guidelines opened a new location and expanded services. Writing this story was difficult as it conflicted with my class schedule in a major way, however it helped me sharpen my time management skills and gave me insight.</p>
            <br><a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_d1d672a4-9796-11e3-9399-0019bb2963f4.html">Habitat Bookworms inch toward $500 goal for Ghana libraries</a>
        <p>Alachua County Habitat for Humanity's bookstore was raising money to send books to Ghana libraries. This story was dear to me because it matched my interests in terms of public relations, nonprofit organizations and fundraising.</p>
            <br><a href="http://www.alligator.org/news/local/article_0aac3234-7e75-11e3-98be-001a4bcf887a.html">City of Gainesville launches open data website</a>
        <p>The City of Gainesville promoted government transparency by launching an open data portal where anyone can view city documents, spending, etc. This story was my first publishing in a major publication. My interest in politics inspired the decision to choose this story.</p>
