        <h2>WHAT'S GOOD IN GAINESVILLE</h2>
        
        <p>What’s Good In Gainesville is a project un-derway in which I will scope out, discover and give a detailed account of those hidden gems within the Gator Nation. More specif-ically, those underappreciated boutiques, stores, and quaint little restaurants throughout Gainesville, Florida.</p>

<p>The blog is dedicated to helping promote these local businesses as well as give readers a heads-up as to what to expect to experience when frequenting these establishments. I hope to open the eyes of Florida Gators to the wonders that await them if they're brave enough to venture from campus.</p>
        
            <p>Many of my post include negativities aimed towards businesses. However, this is just my honest opinions and experiences. I show no bias when reviewing or critiquing these businesses and my reviews are based on my experiences and my experiences alone. No one else has a say in what I post, keeping it 100% genuine.</p>

            <p>WGIG started as an assignment for my multimedia writing class but has since gained momentum and become a side project of mine. While I have little to no interest in becoming a business critic, the blog gave me an outlet for my writing and an excuse to explore the city. I often struggle to find something worth writing. 

            <p>Microblogging, such as through mediums like Tumblr, Pinterest or Polyvore are fun, but do they mean anything? I feel as though What's Good In Gainesville could actually mean something.</p>
            
            <p>I'm also currently working on a music blog in which myself and others rate, review and discuss music, new artists, albums and maybe a bit of fashion. I hope to have the project up and running by the end of summer 2014.</p>
