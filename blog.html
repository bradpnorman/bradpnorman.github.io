        <h1>WHAT'S GOOD IN GAINESVILLE</h1>
        <h2>YOUR #1 DESTINATION FOR THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE AND WHY</h2>
        <a href="http://whatsgoodingainesville.wordpress.com"><img src="img/blog.png" alt="What's Good In Gainesville" style="float: right; margin-right: 5px;"></a>
        
        <p>Whatâ€™s Good In Gainesville is a project underway in which I will scope out, discover and give a detailed account of those hidden gems within the Gator Nation. More specifically, those underappreciated stores, boutiques, and restaurants throughout Gainesville, Fla.</p>

<p>The blog is dedicated to helping promote these local businesses as well as give readers a heads-up as to what to expect to experience when patronizing these establishments.</p>

<p>WGIG started as an assignment for my multimedia writing class but has since gained momentum and become a side project of mine. While I have little to no interest in becoming a business critic, the blog gave me an outlet for my writing and an excuse to explore the city.</p>
